## Meetings

We have meetings every Monday at 6pm. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are meeting over Zoom. Please [Contact Us](/about#contact-us) to join our mailing list or Slack workspace and get our Zoom links sent to your inbox!

Whether you have never participated with ACM before or are an English major, we would love to meet you. Meetings often cover a topic in programming or computing and often involve speakers so you are bound to learn something new!
